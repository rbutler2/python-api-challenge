Observation 1
Based on the plots of max temp in the northern and southern hemisphere we can see that temperature tends to increase the closer the latitude is to zero (the equator) 

Observation 2
The was no correlation between wind speed or cloudiness and latitude. This can be seen by the relevant plots.

Observation 3
IN the northern hemisphere all the low humidity points(less than 20) were near the equator while in the southern hemisphere there were no points of low humidity.
