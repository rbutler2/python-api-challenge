# python-api-challenge
## Activity for class. Uses Python libraries matplotlib, pandas, numpy, requests, time, and scripy.stats inside jupyter notebooks.

###WeatherPy
###### Generate random list of cities. Use the openweathermap api to call weather data of cities in list. Put called data into a DataFrame and export it to output file. Create scatter plots comparing latitude to max tempature, humidity, cloudiness, and windspeed. 
###VacationPy
###### Import the data gathered from WeatherPy. Filter cities to return cities with a max tempature between 70F and 80F, a wind speed of less than 5mph, and a cloudiness of less than 25. Add a hotel name column to the DataFrame and use google api to find the name of the Hotel nearest to the cities longitude and latatude.
